    <h3>Who was Bhagat Singh</h3>
    <p>
      Bhagat Singh was an Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts of
      dramatic violence against the British in India and execution at age 23
      made him a folk hero of the Indian independence movement.

        <h3>Revolutionary Activities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The British government set up the ‘Simon Commission’ to report on the political situation in India in 1928. The commission did not include even a single Indian as its member and this greatly agitated the Indian leaders, leading to protests across the country by Indian political parties.</li>
          <li>The commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928. Lala Lajpat Rai, a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement, led a silent march in protest against the Commission. The British police resorted to violence in their attempts to quell the protest.</li>
          <li>The superintendent of police James A. Scott ordered a baton charge against the protesters and Rai was grievously injured. He died a few days later on 17 November 1928 of a heart attack. His injuries were believed to have hastened his untimely death.</li>
          <li>However, when the matter of his death was raised in the British Parliament, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death. Enraged by this incident, Singh vowed to avenge Rai’s death and teamed up with other revolutionaries, such as Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to plot Scott’s murder.</li>
          <li>The shooting was scheduled to take place on 17 December 1928. Interestingly, a case of mistaken identity ensued and the revolutionaries killed John P. Saunders instead of Scott. Saunders, an assistant superintendent of police, was shot to death as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore.</li>
          <li>The young revolutionaries had already planned an elaborate escape and were successful in evading arrest. A day after Saunders was killed, a leaflet was circulated by the ‘Hindustan Socialist Republican Association,’ announcing that the death of Lala Lajpat Rai had been avenged.</li>
          <li>On 8 April 1929, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, hurled two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its public gallery. Their intention was not to kill anyone but to gain publicity. After the explosion, the young men began shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. Then they allowed the authorities to arrest them.</li>
          <li>Singh was given life sentence for the bombing. Shortly after, he was also charged for the murder of Saunders along with Sukhdev, Rajguru, and 21 others. Meanwhile, his life sentence in the Assembly Bomb case was deferred and he was moved to the ‘Central Jail Mianwali’ from the jail in Delhi.</li>
          <li>In the jail, he noticed that there were vast differences in the manner in which European prisoners and Indian prisoners were treated. So, he went on a hunger strike, demanding equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper. The hunger strike had a direct impact on the rise of public support for Singh and his colleagues.</li>
          <li>Singh’s growing popularity bothered the British authorities greatly and the government decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial, which was henceforth called the ‘Lahore Conspiracy Case.’ Following the trial, Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were sentenced to death by hanging.</li>
          <li>The three men were hanged on 23 March 1931 in Lahore jail. Bhagat Singh was just 23 years old. The bodies were then secretly cremated outside the Ganda Singh Wala village.</li>
